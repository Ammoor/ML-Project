# Evaluation, Analysis & Presentation

Responsible for performance evaluation, comparative analysis, reporting, and presentation.

## Model Evaluation

- Generate confusion matrices for all models
- Perform class-wise performance analysis
- Identify and analyze failure cases (misclassified digits)

## Comparative Analysis

- Quantitative comparison of all implemented models
- Analyze strengths and weaknesses of:
  - MLP Neural Network
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Regression (OvA)
  - Naive Bayes
- Compare computational efficiency and scalability
- Analyze training time vs. accuracy trade-offs

## Hyperparameter & Sensitivity Analysis

- Analyze impact of different hyperparameter choices
- Justify final parameter selections based on results

## Documentation & Presentation

- Prepare the technical report, including:
  - Experimental results
  - Comparative analysis
  - Discussion and conclusions
  - Real-world applicability and limitations
- Create visualizations and plots for results
- Prepare the 5-minute presentation:
  - Slides structure
  - Visual demonstrations
  - Final conclusions
